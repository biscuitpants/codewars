# code wars

Code Wars is a C# varsity project.

Helps those wanting to learn C# by making it an enjoyable game. Still very much a WIP. 

Currently there are 6 levels. Every 3 levels is a tier of difficulty. Meaning:

Level 0 - 2: Easy
Level 3 - 5: Medium
Level 6 - 8: Hard
Level 9 - 12: Insane

More to come in the future.
